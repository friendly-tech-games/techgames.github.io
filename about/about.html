              This is currently a one person operation. I have had a passion for teaching, technology and board games and this my way of sharing that with the world. </br></br>
              In my day job as a cybersecurity architect I often have to explain complex technical topics in a way that is understandable to lovely folks that just do not have that background.
              I find that many people are often intiminated by these topics, and need some encouragment to build confidence. I believe anyone can learn anything with the right mindset. </br></br>
              Many people want to understand technology as it becomes more interwined in our lives as part of the modern world. The idea is to craft fun experiences for all about universal technology concepts in the format of tangible cardboard games. The goal is to make acquiring foundational technology knowledge easier for all.
